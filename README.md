Directions:
- This code is to be compiled with python3.
- In order to run the code, you need to download the sample training data, and remove all of the spaces, and saved into a file named 'data.csv'
- then call main, which will output a png image displaying the directed graph.
- Graphviz must be installed on the user's machine

Requirements:
- The program recursively splits the dataset in 'create_decision_tree' which creates the decision tree by recursively splitting the dataset.
- It makes the information gain calculation using the entropy and conditional entropy formulas in the textbook.
